Gear 3 ("Gear Third") is a

 Gomu Gomu no Mi to inflate 
 a body part and enhance 
 the strength of the user. 
 It was first hinted at 
 during the climax of the 
 fight between Luffy and 
 Blueno, and first used 
 but not witnessed by anyone 
 (including the viewer),to 
 knock down a steel door in 
 Enies Lobby. It was first 
 fully seen in Luffy's fight 
 against Rob Lucci.

After the timeskip, as with 
Gear 2, Luffy seems to have 
obtained better skill at 
utilizing Gear 3. Previously, 
Gear 3 would increase the 
size of the majority of 
Luffy's arm, thus reducing 
the speed of the attack in 
exchange for a powerful impact.
However, Luffy after two years
can seemingly control where 
the air is stored within his 
limbs, where his fist becomes 
large and instead of the air 
being equally distributed 
throughout his arm, an 
equivalently large mass forms
behind the fist at his wrist.

Gear 4 ("Gear Fourth") is a 
transformation technique that 
uses the power of the 
Gomu Gomu no Mi and Busoshoku 
Haki. It has multiple variations 
that enhance some amount of the 
user's defense, speed, and power 
beyond their normal limits. It 
was first seen in Luffy's battle 
against Donquixote Doflamingo. 
It was developed by Luffy during 
his training on Rusukaina.

Luffy's first Gear 4 form is called 
Boundman (Bounce-Man)
: Luffy's proportions become warped, 
and his body becomes much larger 
in size, with his arms, upper 
torso, and legs coated in 
Busoshoku Haki. As a side-effect, 
he is incapable of standing 
still on the ground, and instead 
constantly bounds on the spot. 
This form was created in order 
to combat the many powerful and 
large animals on Rusukaina.

"Snakeman" redirects here. For the gifter of the Beasts Pirates, 
see Snakeman (Gifter).During his battle with Charlotte Katakuri, 
Luffy revealed another form of Gear 4 known as Snakeman (Snake-Man). 
Unlike his other two Gear 4 forms, Luffy does not significantly expand, 
with his forearms, legs, and upper torso being only slightly enlarged 
and the rest of his body retaining its normal proportions. The spread 
of Haki is slightly more limited, as it does not appear to extend onto 
Luffy's shoulders and upper body.

Gear 5 ("Gear Fifth") is the awakened form of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, 
which strengthens the user's rubbery body. It also allows the user the 
ability to manipulate and transform their environment, similar to a 
Paramecia's awakening. Luffy achieved this ability during his final 
battle with Kaidou on Onigashima.
